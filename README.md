# microservice-admin

This is a sample microservice I created using Java springboot

It's your typical CRUD with 2 models using DDD (domain driven design) approach.

It was developed using
- Java 1.8
- functionaljava library, https://www.functionaljava.org/
- ~liquidbase~ flyway for data management
- H2 database
